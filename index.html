                Based in Chicago, Illinois, Little Lemon is a family-owned Mediterranean restaurant, focused on
                traditional recipes served with a modern twist. The chefs draw inspiration from Italian, Greek,
                and Turkish culture and have a menu of 12â€“15 items that they rotate seasonally. The restaurant
                has a rustic and relaxed atmosphere with moderate prices, making it a popular place for a meal
                any time of the day.

                    Little Lemon is owned by two Italian brothers, Mario and Adrian, who moved to the United States
                    to pursue their shared dream of owning a restaurant. To craft the menu, Mario relies on family
                    recipes and his experience as a chef in Italy. Adrian does all the marketing for the restaurant
                    and led the effort to expand the menu beyond classic Italian to incorporate additional cuisines
                    from the Mediterranean region.
